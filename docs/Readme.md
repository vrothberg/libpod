## API Reference

The [latest online documentation](http://docs.podman.io/en/latest/_static/api.html) is
automatically generated by two cooperating automation systems based on committed upstream
source code.  Firstly, [the Cirrus-CI docs task](../contrib/cirrus/README.md#docs-task) builds
`pkg/api/swagger.yaml` and uploads it to a public-facing location (Google Storage Bucket -
an online service for storing unstructured data).  Second, [Read The Docs](readthedocs.com)
reacts to the github.com repository change, building the content for the [libpod documentation
site](https://podman.readthedocs.io/).  This site includes for the API section,
some javascript which consumes the uploaded `swagger.yaml` file directly from the Google
Storage Bucket.

Since there are multiple systems and local cache is involved, it's possible that updates to
documentation (especially the swagger/API docs) will lag by 10-or-so minutes.  However,
because the client (i.e. your web browser) is fetching content from multiple locations that
do not share a common domain, accessing the API section may show a stack-trace similar to
the following:

![Javascript Stack Trace Image](../contrib/cirrus/swagger_stack_trace.png)

If reloading the page, or clearing your local cache does not fix the problem, it is
likely caused by broken metadata needed to protect clients from cross-site-scripting
style attacks.  Please [notify a maintainer](https://github.com/containers/podman#communications)
so they may investigate how/why the swagger.yaml file's CORS-metadata is incorrect.  See
[the Cirrus-CI tasks documentation](../contrib/cirrus/README.md#docs-task) for
details regarding this situation.
